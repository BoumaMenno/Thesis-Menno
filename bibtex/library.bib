@article{Seuret2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 1963-2012 IEEE. This technical note is concerned with the stability analysis of discrete linear systems with time-varying delays. The novelty of the technical note comes from the consideration of a new inequality which is less conservative than the celebrated Jensen inequality employed in the context of discrete-time delay systems. This inequality is a discrete-time counterpart of the Wirtinger-based integral inequality that was recently employed for the improved analysis of continuous-tine systems with delays. However, differently from the continuous-time case, the proof of the new inequality is not based on the Wirtinger inequality. The method is also combined with an efficient representation of the improved reciprocally convex combination inequality in order to reduce the conservatism induced by the LMIs optimization setup. The effectiveness of the proposed result is illustrated by some classical examples from the literature.},

@article{Hausler2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 IEEE.We propose a numerical algorithm for multiple-vehicle motion planning that explicitly takes into account the vehicle dynamics, temporal and spatial specifications, and energy-related requirements. As a motivating example, we consider the case where a group of vehicles is tasked to reach a number of target points at the same time (simultaneous arrival problem) without colliding among themselves and with obstacles, subject to the requirement that the overall energy required for vehicle motion be minimized. With the theoretical setup adopted, the vehicle dynamics are explicitly taken into account at the planning level. This paper formulates the problem of multiple-vehicle motion planning in a rigorous mathematical setting, describes the optimization algorithm used to solve it, and discusses the key implementation details. The efficacy of the method is illustrated through numerical examples for the simultaneous arrival problem. The initial guess to start the optimization procedure is obtained from simple geometrical considerations, e.g., by joining the desired initial and final positions of the vehicles via straight lines. Even though the initial trajectories thus obtained may result in intervehicle and vehicle/obstacle collisions, we show that the optimization procedure that we employ in this paper will generate collision-free trajectories that also minimize the overall energy spent by each vehicle and meet the required temporal and spatial constraints. The method developed applies to a very general class of vehicles; however, for clarity of exposition, we adopt as an illustrative example the case of wheeled robots.},

abstract = {Reference-spreading based trajectory tracking is a recently introduced control strategy for hybrid systems with state-triggered jumps that allows to handle the time mismatch between nominal and closed-loop impact times. In this paper, we demonstrate that the approach can handle even the change in state dimension corresponding to, e.g., the activation of a unilateral contact constraint occurring when dealing with mechanical systems experiencing inelastic impacts. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by means of simulations, addressing a trajectory tracking problem for a two-link robotic leg performing a hopping motion. The robot leg is modeled as a hybrid system possessing two different dynamic phases (stance and flight) with different state dimensions. Robustness of the approach, in particular to inexact measurement of robot height with respect to the ground, is also discussed.},

@article{Hindmarsh1984,
abstract = {We describe a modification to our recent model of the action potential which introduces two additional equilibrium points. By using stability analysis we show that one of these equilibrium points is a saddle point from which there are two separatrices which divide the phase plane into two regions. In one region all phase paths approach a limit cycle and in the other all phase paths approach a stable equilibrium point. A consequence of this is that a short depolarizing current pulse will change an initially silent model neuron into one that fires repetitively. Addition of a third equation limits this firing to either an isolated burst or a depolarizing afterpotential. When steady depolarizing current was applied to this model it resulted in periodic bursting. The equations, which were initially developed to explain isolated triggered bursts, therefore provide one of the simplest models of the more general phenomenon of oscillatory burst discharge.},

abstract = {Motivated by applications of systems interacting with their environments, we study the design of passivity-based controllers for a class of hybrid systems in which the energy dissipation may only happen along either the continuous or the discrete dynamics. A general definition of passivity, encompassing the said special cases, is introduced and, along with detectability and solution conditions, linked to stability and asymptotic stability of compact sets. The proposed results allow us to take advantage of the passivity property of the system at flows or at jumps and are employed to design passivity-based controllers for the class of hybrid systems of interest. Two applications, one pertaining to a point mass physically interacting with a wall and another about controlling a ball bouncing on an actuated surface, illustrate the definitions and results throughout the paper. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

For the neural networks under study, a generalized activation function is considered, where the traditional assumptions on the boundedness, monotony and differentiability of the activation functions are removed. By constructing proper Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing a combination of the free-weighting matrix method and stochastic analysis technique, a delay-dependent passivity condition is derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Furthermore, when the parameter uncertainties appear in the discrete-time stochastic neural networks with time-varying delays, a delay-dependent robust passivity condition is also presented.

@article{Liu2008,
abstract = {In this paper, a synchronization problem is investigated for an array of coupled complex discrete-time networks with the simultaneous presence of both the discrete and distributed time delays. The complex networks addressed which include neural and social networks as special cases are quite general. Rather than the commonly used Lipschitz-type function, a more general sector-like nonlinear function is employed to describe the nonlinearities existing in the network. The distributed infinite time delays in the discrete-time domain are first defined. By utilizing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the Kronecker product, it is shown that the addressed discrete-time complex network with distributed delays is synchronized if certain linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) are feasible. The state estimation problem is then studied for the same complex network, where the purpose is to design a state estimator to estimate the network states through available output measurements such that, for all admissible discrete and distributed delays, the dynamics of the estimation error is guaranteed to be globally asymptotically stable. Again, an LMI approach is developed for the state estimation problem. Two simulation examples are provided to show the usefulness of the proposed global synchronization and state estimation conditions. It is worth pointing out that our main results are valid even if the nominal subsystems within the network are unstable.},

Three control algorirhms that regulate the machine's hopping height are presented and tested experimentally. These are: (i) a tabular control scheme that selects the control input on the basis of the desired steady-state hopping height; (ii) a near-inverse controller based on a discrete, hop-to-hop model of the plant dynamics; and (iii) a near-inverse controller with integral error feedback. The machine's transient and steady-state behavior is evaluated for each controller. The effectiveness of the algorithms is further assessed by subjecting the controlled system to abrupt changes in the body mass. Experimental data indicate that the near- inverse controller with integral height-error feedback gives the best results in compensating for parameter variations. I.},

abstract = {This paper studies the consensus problem of multi-agent systems in an asynchronous framework. Under certain assumptions, the consensus protocol leads to stable behaviors even if the updating instants and sets of the agents are asynchronously determined. The model of asynchronous multi-agent systems encompasses those synchronous ones with various communication patterns, i.e., issues of directional, delayed, or failed communication can be addressed in the same framework. The asynchronous results in this paper thus shed new light on the synchronous results reported in the literature. In particular, synchronous protocols under dynamically changing interaction topologies can be seen as a special case of the asynchronous protocol where all communication delays are zero.},

Energetic consistency is generally proven for frictionless systems, as well as for systems containing one single frictional contact.

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the robust synchronization problem for an array of coupled stochastic discrete-time neural networks with time-varying delay. The individual neural network is subject to parameter uncertainty, stochastic disturbance, and time-varying delay, where the norm-bounded parameter uncertainties exist in both the state and weight matrices, the stochastic disturbance is in the form of a scalar Wiener process, and the time delay enters into the activation function. For the array of coupled neural networks, the constant coupling and delayed coupling are simultaneously considered. We aim to establish easy-to-verify conditions under which the addressed neural networks are synchronized. By using the Kronecker product as an effective tool, a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach is developed to derive several sufficient criteria ensuring the coupled delayed neural networks to be globally, robustly, exponentially synchronized in the mean square. The LMI-based conditions obtained are dependent not only on the lower bound but also on the upper bound of the time-varying delay, and can be solved efficiently via the Matlab LMI Toolbox. Two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed synchronization scheme.},

In such networks, each node, when uncoupled, is described by a nonlinear ordinary differential equation of the form ẋ = f (x,t) . In this paper, we establish links between the QUAD condition on f (x, t), i.e.,(x-y)T[f(x, t)-f(y, t)] - (x-y)T $\Delta$(x-y) ≤-$\omega$(x-y)T(x-y) for some arbitrary $\Delta$ and $\omega$, and contraction theory. We then investigate the relationship between the assumption of f being Lipschitz and the QUAD condition. We show the usefulness of the links highlighted in this paper to obtain proofs of asymptotic synchronization in networks of identical nonlinear oscillators and illustrate the results via numerical simulations on some representative examples.

abstract = {This paper addresses the synchronization problem of mechanical systems subjected to a single geometric unilateral constraint. The impacts of the individual systems, induced by the unilateral constraint, generally do not coincide even if the solutions are arbitrarily ‘close' to each other. The mismatch in the impact time instants demands a careful choice of the distance function to allow for an intuitively correct comparison of the discontinuous solutions resulting from the impacts. We propose a distance function induced by the quotient metric, which is based on an equivalence relation using the impact map. The distance function obtained in this way is continuous in time when evaluated along jumping solutions. The property of maximal monotonicity, which is fulfilled by most commonly used impact laws, is used to significantly reduce the complexity of the distance function. Based on the simplified distance function, a Lyapunov function is constructed to investigate the synchronization problem for two identical one-dimensional mechanical systems. Sufficient conditions for the uncoupled individual systems are provided under which local synchronization is guaranteed. Furthermore, we present an interaction law which ensures global synchronization, also in the presence of grazing trajectories and accumulation points (Zeno behavior). The results are illustrated using numerical examples of a 1-DOF mechanical impact oscillator which serves as stepping stone in the direction of more general systems.},

The version presented here consists of two monumental pendulum clocks-ad hoc designed and fabricated-which are coupled through a wooden structure. It is demonstrated that the coupled clocks exhibit 'sympathetic' motion, i.e. the pendula of the clocks oscillate in consonance and in the same direction. Interestingly, when the clocks are synchronized, the common oscillation frequency decreases, i.e. the clocks become slow and inaccurate. In order to rigorously explain these findings, a mathematical model for the coupled clocks is obtained by using well-established physical and mechanical laws and likewise, a theoretical analysis is conducted. Ultimately, the sympathy of two monumental pendulum clocks, interacting via a flexible coupling structure, is experimentally, numerically, and analytically demonstrated.},

abstract = {The problem of tracking a time-varying reference trajectory of a mechanical system with unilateral position constraints is addressed in this paper. We present for the first time simulation and experimental results of a recently introduced trajectory tracking controller for hybrid systems with state jumps. The controller is applied to (locally) stabilize a time-varying trajectory of a 1-DOF robotic arm impacting and bouncing off an aluminum rod. The arm is modeled as a rigid link with viscous and Coulomb friction. The impact phenomenon is assumed to instantaneously reset the velocity in accordance with the classical Newton's law of restitution. Kine- matic and dynamic identified parameter values are reported. The employed controller, hereafter called “hybrid PD controller with acceleration feedforward”, requires the real time detection on each impact in order to properly define the error signal. To this end, a force sensor and a triggering logic based on a force threshold are employed.},

Next, we consider the network structure under which the synchronization error dynamics has a trivial solution at zero and derive a necessary condition for synchronization with respect to the network structure. Using these facts, we then derive sufficient conditions for synchronization of the systems in terms of linear matrix inequalities via the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach.

Sliding friction is known to yield singularities in the system, such as Painlev{\'{e}}'s paradox. Our work aims at providing sufficient conditions on the parameters of the system so that singularities are avoided (i.e., the contact problem is at least solvable). To this end, the frictional problem is treated as a perturbation of the frictionless case. We provide explicit criteria, in the form of calculable upper bounds on the friction coefficients, under which the frictional contact problem is guaranteed to remain well-posed. Complementarity problems, variational inequalities, quadratic programs and inclusions in normal cones are central tools.},

abstract = {This paper presents the methodology used to achieve efficient and dynamic walking behaviors on the prototype humanoid robotics platform, DURUS. As a means of providing a hardware platform capable of these behaviors, the design of DURUS combines highly efficient electromechanical components with “control in the loop” design of the leg morphology. Utilizing the final design of DURUS, a formal framework for the generation of dynamic walking gaits which maximizes efficiency by exploiting the full body dynamics of the robot, including the interplay between the passive and active elements, is developed. The gaits generated through this methodology form the basis of the control implementation experimentally realized on DURUS; in particular, the trajectories generated through the formal framework yield a feedforward control input which is modulated by feedback in the form of regulators that compensate for discrepancies between the model and physical system. The end result of the unified approach to control-informed mechanical design, formal gait design and regulator-based feedback control implementation is efficient and dynamic locomotion on the humanoid robot DURUS. In particular, DURUS was able to demonstrate dynamic locomotion at the DRC Finals Endurance Test, walking for just under five hours in a single day, traveling 3.9 km with a mean cost of transport of 1.61-the lowest reported cost of transport achieved on a bipedal humanoid robot.},

abstract = {We consider a benchmark example of a three-link planar biped walker with torso, which is actuated in between the legs. The torso is thought to be kept upright by two identical torsional springs. The mathematical model reflects a three-degree-of-freedom mechanical system with impulse effects, which describe the impacts of the swing leg with the ground, and the aim is to induce stable limit-cycle walking on level ground. The main contribution is a novel systematic trajectory planning procedure for solving the problem of gait synthesis. The key idea is to find a system of ordinary differential equations for the functions describing a synchronization pattern for the time evolution of the generalized coordinates along a periodic motion. These functions, which are known as virtual holonomic constraints, are also used to compute an impulsive linear system that approximates the time evolution of the subset of coordinates that are transverse to the orbit of the continuous part of the periodic solution. This auxiliary system, which is known as transverse linearization, is used to design a nonlinear exponentially orbitally stabilizing feedback controller. The performance of the closed-loop system and its robustness with respect to various perturbations and uncertainties are illustrated via numerical simulations.},

abstract = {In this paper, we study the tracking problem for Lur'e-type measure differential inclusions. The framework of measure differential inclusions allows us to describe systems with discontinuities in the state evolution, such as mechanical systems with unilateral constraints. As a stepping stone, we present results on the stability of time-varying solutions of such systems in the scope of the convergence property. Next, this property is exploited to provide a solution to the tracking problem. The results are illustrated by application to a mechanical motion system with a unilateral velocity constraint.},

abstract = {This paper presents a human-inspired control ap- proach to bipedal robotic walking: utilizing human data and output functions that appear to be intrinsic to human walking in order to formally design controllers that provably result in stable robotic walking. Beginning with human walking data, out- puts—or functions of the kinematics—are determined that result in a low-dimensional representation of human locomotion. These same outputs can be considered on a robot, and human-inspired control is used to drive the outputs of the robot to the outputs of the human. The main results of this paper are that, in the case of both under and full actuation, the parameters of this controller can be determined through a human-inspired optimiza- tion problem that provides the best fitofthe humandatawhile simultaneously provably guaranteeing stable robotic walking for whichthe initialcondition canbecomputedinclosedform. These formal results are demonstrated in simulation by considering two bipedal robots—an underactuated 2-D bipedal robot, AMBER, and fully actuated 3-D bipedal robot, NAO—for which stable robotic walking is automatically obtained using only human data. Moreover, in both cases, these simulated walking gaits are realized experimentally to obtain human-inspired bipedal walking on the actual robots.},

@article{Elkaranshawy2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V. This paper introduces an analysis of tangential velocity of the contact point during a single-point impact with friction in three-dimensional rigid multibody systems. Considering the normal component of impulse at the contact point as the independent variable, a system of nonlinear differential equations describing the progress of the tangential velocity is derived. Quartic algebraic equations for the invariant and the flow change directions are obtained. The system of differential equations could have a discontinuity problem if the tangential velocity instantaneously vanishes. Effectively, this problem is mathematically solved and the new sliding direction is specified. During impact, the sliding direction could continuously change or the sliding could stop and the non-sliding continues or the sliding could restart along a new direction. The stick-slip effect could also have its influence. Two friction models are used, and an appropriate numerical procedure is suggested that can handle all the possible sliding scenarios. To verify the proposed method, the numerical solution is compared to the analytical solution for a special case of a homogeneous ellipsoid that collides with a horizontal fixed rough surface. A case study of a four-degrees-of-freedom spatial robot that collides with its environment is considered. The bifurcation associated with the variation of the kinetic coefficient of friction is investigated, and a set of threshold values of it are determined. Some phase portraits are drawn, and the invariant directions and flow change directions are drawn for all portraits. Each portrait represents all the flow trajectories of the tangential velocity for different initial conditions with a specific kinetic coefficient of friction. This qualitative analysis not only helps in understanding the behavior of multibody systems in such situations but also it gives insight to the physical phenomenon of impact itself.},

@book{Beig2002,
abstract = {The series Lecture Notes in Physics reports new developments in physical research and teaching – quickly, informally, and at a high level. The proceedings to be considered for publication in this series should be limited to only a few areas of research, and these should be closely related to each other. The contributions should be of a high standard and should avoid lengthy redraftings of papers already published or about to be published elsewhere. As a whole, the proceedings should aim for a balanced presentation of the theme of the conference including a description of the techniques used and enough motivation for a broad readership. It should not be assumed that the published proceedings must reflect the conference in its entirety. (A listing or abstracts of papers presented at the meeting but not included in the proceedings could be added as an appendix.) When applying for publication in the series Lecture Notes in Physics the volume's editor(s) should submit sufficient material to enable the series editors and their referees to make a fairly accurate evaluation (e.g. a complete list of speakers and titles of papers to be presented and abstracts). If, based on this information, the proceedings are (tentatively) accepted, the volume's editor(s), whose name(s) will appear on the title pages, should select the papers suitable for publication and have them refereed (as for a journal) when appropriate. As a rule discussions will not be accepted. The series editors and Springer-Verlag will normally not interfere with the detailed editing except in fairly obvious cases or on technical matters. Final acceptance is expressed by the series editor in charge, in consultation with Springer-Verlag only after receiving the complete manuscript. It might help to send a copy of the authors' manuscripts in advance to the editor in charge to discuss possible revisions with him. As a general rule, the series editor will confirm his tentative acceptance if the final manuscript corresponds to the original concept discussed, if the quality of the contribution meets the requirements of the series, and if the final size of the manuscript does not greatly exceed the number of pages originally agreed upon. The manuscript should be forwarded to Springer-Verlag shortly after the meeting. In cases of extreme delay (more than six months after the conference) the series editors will check once more the timeliness of the papers. Therefore, the volume's editor(s) should establish strict deadlines, or collect the articles during the conference and have them revised on the spot. If a delay is unavoidable, one should encourage the authors to update their contributions if appropriate. The editors of proceedings are strongly advised to inform contributors about these points at an early stage. The final manuscript should contain a table of contents and an informative introduction accessible also to readers not particularly familiar with the topic of the conference. The contributions should be in English. The volume's editor(s) should check the contributions for the correct use of language. At Springer-Verlag only the prefaces will be checked by a copy-editor for language and style. Grave linguistic or technical shortcomings may lead to the rejection of contributions by the series editors. A conference report should not exceed a total of 500 pages. Keeping the size within this bound should be achieved by a stricter selection of articles and not by imposing an upper limit to the length of the individual papers. Editors receive jointly 30 complimentary copies of their book. They are entitled to purchase further copies of their book at a reduced rate. As a rule no reprints of individual contributions can be supplied. No royalty is paid on Lecture Notes in Physics volumes. Commitment to publish is made by letter of interest rather than by signing a formal contract. Springer-Verlag secures the copyright for each volume.},

abstract = {This paper presents implementation of a highly dynamic running gait with a hierarchical controller on the MIT Chee-tah. The developed controller enables high-speed running of up to 6 m/s (Froude number of Fr ≈ 7.34) incorporating proprioceptive feedback and programmable virtual leg compliance of the MIT Cheetah. To achieve a stable and fast trot gait, we applied three control strategies: (a) programmable virtual leg compliance that provides instantaneous reflexes to external disturbance and facilitates the self-stabilizing shown in the passive dynamics of locomotion; (b) tunable stance-trajectory design, intended to adjust impulse at each foot-end in the stance phase in a high speed trot-running according to the equilibrium-point hypothesis; and (c) a gait-pattern modulation that imposes a desired cyclic gait-pattern taking cues from proprioceptive TD feedback. Based on three strategies, the controller is hierarchically structured. The control parameters for forward speeds, a specific gait-pattern, and desired leg trajectories are managed by a high-level controller. It consists of both a gait-pattern modulator with proprioceptive leg TD detection and a leg-trajectory generator using a B{\`{e}}zier curve and a tunable amplitude sinusoidal wave. Instead of employing physical spring/dampers in the robot's leg, the programmable virtual leg compliance is realized using proprioceptive impedance control in individual low-level leg controllers. To verify the developed controller, a robot dynamic simulator is constructed based on the model parameters of the MIT Cheetah. The controller parameters are tuned with the simulator to achieve self-stability, and then applied to the MIT Cheetah in an experimental environment. Using leg kinematics and applied motor current feedbacks, the MIT Cheetah achieved a stable trot-running gait in the sagittal plane.},

To this end, a so-called reference spreading hybrid control law is designed showing promising results in simulation. The simulations are performed employing a dynamical model of an existing humanoid robot and impacts are assumed to be inelastic. The desired motion task consists of having the robot balancing on one foot while repeatedly making and breaking contact with a wall by means of one hand. The simulation results illustrate that the considered controller is suited to control humanoid robot motions with impacts.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the sensitivity analysis for hybrid systems with discontinuous (jumping) state trajectories. We consider state-triggered jumps in the state evolution, potentially accompanied by mode switching in the control vector field as well. For a given trajectory with state jumps, we show how to construct an approximation of a nearby perturbed trajectory corresponding to a small variation of the initial condition and input. A major complication in the construction of such an approximation is that, in general, the jump times corresponding to a nearby perturbed trajectory are not equal to those of the nominal one. The main contribution of this work is the development of a notion of error to clarify in which sense the approximate trajectory is, at each instant of time, a firstorder approximation of the perturbed trajectory. This notion of error naturally finds application in the (local) tracking problem of a time-varying reference trajectory of a hybrid system. To illustrate the possible use of this new error definition in the context of trajectory tracking, we outline how the standard linear trajectory tracking control for nonlinear systems -based on linear quadratic regulator (LQR) theory to compute the optimal feedback gain- could be generalized for hybrid systems.},

abstract = {Hybrid systems which are capable of exhibiting simultaneously several kinds of dynamic behavior in different parts of a system (e.g., continuous-time dynamics, discrete-time dynamics, jump phenomena, switching and logic commands, and the like) are of great current interest. In the present paper we first formulate a model for hybrid dynamical systems which covers a very large class of systems and which is suitable for the qualitative analysis of such systems. Next, we introduce the notion of an invariant set (e.g., equilibrium) for hybrid dynamical systems and we define several types of (Lyapunov-like) stability concepts for an invariant set.We then establish sufficient conditions for uniform stability, uniform asymptotic stability, exponential stability, and instability of an invariant set of hybrid dynamical systems. Under some mild additional assumptions, we also establish necessary conditions for some of the above stability types (converse theorems). In addition to the above, we also establish sufficient conditions for the uniform boundedness of the motions of hybrid dynamical systems (Lagrange stability). To demonstrate the applicability of the developed theory, we present specific examples of hybrid dynamical systems and we conduct a stability analysis of some of these examples (a class of sampled- data feedback control systems with a nonlinear (continuous-time) plant and a linear (discrete-time) controller, and a class of systems with impulse effects).},

abstract = {The use of linear statistical methods in building climate prediction models is examined, particularly the use of anomalies. The author's perspective is that the climate system is a nonlinear interacting system, so the impact of modeling using anomalies rather than observed data directly is considered. With reference to the Lorenz system and a simple model for regime dependence, it is shown that anomalies impair our ability to reconstruct nonlinear dynamics. Some alternative approaches in the literature that offer an attractive way forward are explored, focusing on Bayesian hierarchical methods to construct so-called physical-statistical models. The author's view is that anomalies should be reserved in most cases as a tool for enhancing graphical representations of climate data. The exceptions are when the implicit assumptions underlying the use of anomalies are met or when an anomaly representation is physically motivated.},

The reference trajectories are given by functions that may exhibit jumps. The class of controllers considered are also modeled as hybrid systems. These are designed to guarantee stability of tracking and that the difference between the plant's state and the reference trajectory converges to zero. Using recently developed tools for the study of asymptotic stability in hybrid systems, we recast the tracking problem as the problem of stabilizing a closed set and derive conditions for the design of tracking controllers for hybrid reference trajectories with the property that the jump times of the plant coincide with those of the given reference trajectories. The approach is illustrated in examples.},

This book opens up an important new research area in which convex optimization is combined with system and control theory, resulting in the solution of a large number of previously unsolved problems. Audience This book is primarily intended for researchers in system and control theory; both the beginner and the advanced researcher will find the book useful.

Based on the prismatic inverted pendulum model, we formulate a hybrid phase-space planning and control framework which includes the following key components: (1) a step transition solver that enables dynamically tracking non-periodic apex or keyframe states over various types of terrains, (2) a robust hybrid automaton to effectively formulate planning and control algorithms, (3) a phase-space metric to measure distance to the planned locomotion manifolds, and (4) a hybrid control method based on the previous distance metric to produce robust dynamic locomotion under external disturbances. Compared to other locomotion frameworks, we have a larger focus on non-periodic gait generation and robustness metrics to deal with disturbances. Such focus enables the proposed control framework to robustly track non-periodic apex states over various challenging terrains and under external disturbances as illustrated through several simulations. Additionally, it allows a bipedal robot to perform non-periodic bouncing maneuvers over disjointed terrains.},

abstract = {An impact model for two-dimensional contact situations is developed which contains the main physical effects of a compliance element in the normal direction and a series of a compliance and Coulomb friction elements in the tangential direction. For systems with multiple impacts a unilateral formulation based on Poisson's hypothesis is used to describe the impulses which are transferred in the normal direction. The event of an impact is divided into two phases. The phase of compression ends with vanishing approaching velocity if normal impulses are transferred and is equivalent to a completely inelastic collision. The phase of expansion allows the bodies to separate under the action of the normal impulses whenever they are large enough. The absolute values of the tangential impulses are bounded by the magnitudes of the normal impulses, due to the Coulomb friction relationship on the impulse level. One part of the transferred tangential impulse during compression is assumed to be partly reversible which may be regarded as an application of Poisson's law. The remaining part is completely irreversible and considered friction. This formulation contains the special case of completely elastic tangential impacts as well as the situation when only Coulomb friction acts. It is proven that the presented impact model is always dissipative or energy preserving. The evaluation of the problem is done by solving one set of complementarity conditions during compression and a nearly identical set of equations during expansion. The theory is applied to some basic examples which demonstrate the difference between Newton's and Poisson's hypotheses.},

This scaling law is almost independent of the map parameter. In the case of coexistence of chaotic and periodic attractors, very complex dynamics is observed, including the emergence of new attractors as the coupling strength is increased.

abstract = {The purpose of this book is to provide core material in nonlinear analysis for mathematicians, physicists, engineers, and mathematical biologists. The main goal is to provide a working knowledge of manifolds, dynamical systems, tensors, and differential forms. Some applications to Hamiltonian mechanics, fluid me­ chanics, electromagnetism, plasma dynamics and control thcory arc given in Chapter 8, using both invariant and index notation. The current edition of the book does not deal with Riemannian geometry in much detail, and it does not treat Lie groups, principal bundles, or Morse theory. Some of this is planned for a subsequent edition. Meanwhile, the authors will make available to interested readers supplementary chapters on Lie Groups and Differential Topology and invite comments on the book's contents and development. Throughout the text supplementary topics are given, marked with the symbols {\~{}} and {\{}l:;J. This device enables the reader to skip various topics without disturbing the main flow of the text. Some of these provide additional background material intended for completeness, to minimize the necessity of consulting too many outside references. We treat finite and infinite-dimensional manifolds simultaneously. This is partly for efficiency of exposition. Without advanced applications, using manifolds of mappings, the study of infinite-dimensional manifolds can be hard to motivate.}},

A simple impulse planning algorithm is proposed to design vertical and horizontal force profiles which make net impulse on the system during one cycle zero. This design of force profiles leads to the conservation of linear momentum over a complete step, providing periodicity in horizontal and vertical velocity. When designed profiles are applied to the system, periodic orbits with an ability to change running speed are obtained. A virtual compliance control in the horizontal and vertical direction has been added onto the designed force profiles to stabilize the periodic orbits. The experimental results show that the algorithm successfully achieved untethered 3D running of the MIT Cheetah 2, with speeds ranging from 0 m/sec to 4.5 m/sec on treadmills as well as on grassy fields.},

@article{Raibert1984,
abstract = {In this paper a two-dimensional one-legged hopping machine is modeled and simulated in order to better understand legged systems that hop and run. The analysis is focused on balance, dynamic stability, and resonant oscillation for the planar case. A springy leg with nonzero mass, a simple body, and an actuated hinge-type hip are incorporated in the model. Control of the model is decomposed into a vertical hopping part, a horizontal velocity part, and a body attitude part. Estimates of total system energy are used in regulating hopping height in order to initiate hopping, to maintain level hopping, to change from one hopping height to another, and to terminate hopping. Balance and control of forward velocity are explored with three algorithms. First the role of foot placement in balance through a linear algorithm that stabilizes the system and generates low velocity translations from point to point is studied. Second, control of forward velocity is controlled by considering constraints that arise in constant velocity forward travel, and the CG print is introduced. In the improved algorithm the foot is placed forward with respect to the center of the CG print during flight, and the leg is swept backward during stance. Third, control of body attitude is improved by using the hip actuator to correct pitch errors during stance. The feasibility of decomposing control of running into a height control part, a forward velocity control part, and an attitude control part are verified by simulations. I. Introduction},

@article{Fang2006,
abstract = {Motivated by the emergence of new applications of networked, large-scale multiagent systems, we study several important and related problems in this area: asynchronous consensus (agreement) problems, formation tracking control, and switched linear control. The overall goal is to understand special challenges raised from information constraints and to develop robust control strategies which improve the stability and performance of such systems. We start our investigation with asynchronous consensus problems for discrete time multi-agent systems. In this setup, a number of agents update their states asynchronously by using (possibly outdated) information from their neighbors in order to reach an agreement regarding a certain quantity of interest. Under fixed interaction topologies, we show that consensus can be reached with linear protocols. We further show that consensus is reachable under directional and time-varying topologies with nonlinear protocols. The confluent iteration graph is introduced to incorporate various communication assumptions and it proves to be fundamental in understanding the convergence of consensus processes. Secondly, we study formation tracking problems which can be stated as multiple vehicles with nonlinear dynamics being required to follow reference trajectories while keeping a desired inter-vehicle formation pattern in time. We specify formations using the vectors of relative positions of neighboring vehicles and use consensus-based controllers for decentralized formation tracking control. The key idea is to combine consensus-based controllers with the cascaded approach to tracking control, resulting in a group of linearly coupled dynamical systems. We examine the stability properties of the closed loop system using cascaded systems theory and nonlinear synchronization theory. In particular, we identify a link between a property on the graph Laplacian of the information structure and the formation stability. The last part of the dissertation is dedicated to switched systems, which are natural mathematical models for time-varying topologies among agents and are of theoretical interest on their own. By using tools from convex analysis, we provide a new proof to a necessary and sufficient stability condition for switched systems under arbitrarily switching. The switched Lyapunov function is then combined with Finslers' Lemma to generate various LMI conditions for control synthesis and performance analysis of switched systems.},

abstract = {The comparison between time-varying hybrid trajectories is crucial for tracking, observer design and synchronisation problems for hybrid systems with state-triggered jumps. In this paper, a generic distance function is designed that can be used for this purpose. The so-called “peaking phenomenon”, which occurs when using the Euclidean distance to compare two hybrid trajectories, is circumvented by taking the hybrid nature of the system explicitly into account. Based on the proposed distance function, we define the stability of a trajectory and present sufficient Lyapunov-type conditions for hybrid system with state-triggered jumps. A constructive Lyapunov function design is presented for hybrid systems with affine flow and jump maps and a jump set that is a hyperplane. The stability conditions can then be verified using linear matrix conditions. Finally, for this class of systems, we present a tracking controller that asymptotically stabilises a given hybrid reference trajectory and we illustrate our results with an example.},

abstract = {Control of mechanical systems with backlash is a topic well studied by many control practitioners. This interest has been motivated by the fact that backlash in mechanical systems can cause severe performance degradation and lead to instability of the control system. Furthermore, high impact-forces in backlash-systems can lead to a lower durability of the components and to strokes and peaks in the output. In this paper a mechanical benchmark system is presented to provide facilities for testing the identification and control of systems with backlash. For controller design a hybrid model of the system was derived and used in a model predictive control (MPC) scheme. Observer-based state-estimation was used to recover unmeasured states, particularly the backlash angle. Explicit solutions of a tracking controller were computed to control the mechanical benchmark system in real-time. Simulation as well as experimental results are presented to show the applicability of this hybrid control approach.},

abstract = {We study the problem of designing state-feedback controllers to track time-varying state trajectories that may exhibit jumps. Both plants and controllers considered are modeled as hybrid dynamical systems, which are systems with both continuous and discrete dynamics, given in terms of a flow set, a flow map, a jump set, and a jump map. Using recently developed tools for the study of stability in hybrid systems, we recast the tracking problem as the task of asymptotically stabilizing a set, the tracking set, and derive conditions for the design of state-feedback tracking controllers with the property that the jump times of the plant coincide with those of the given reference trajectories. The resulting tracking controllers guarantee that solutions of the plant starting close to the reference trajectory stay close to it and that the difference between each solution of the controlled plant and the reference trajectory converges to zero asymptotically. Constructive conditions for tracking control design in terms of LMIs are proposed for a class of hybrid systems with linear maps and input-triggered jumps. The results are illustrated by various examples.},

abstract = {Results on input-output Lp stability of networked control systems (NCS) are presented for a large class of network scheduling protocols. It is shown that static protocols and a recently considered dynamical protocol called try-once-discard belong to this class. Our results provide a unifying framework for generating new scheduling protocols that preserve Lp stability properties of the system if a design parameter is chosen sufficiently small. The most general version of our results can be used to treat NCS with data packet dropouts. The model of NCS and, in particular, of the scheduling protocol that we use appears to be novel and we believe that it will be useful in further study of these systems. The proof technique we use is based on the small gain theorem and it lends itself to an easy interpretation. We prove that our results are guaranteed to be better than existing results in the literature and we illustrate this via an example of a batch reactor.},

Here, we introduce a time-varying complex dynamical network model and further investigate its synchronization phenomenon. Based on this new complex network model, two network chaos synchronization theorems are proved. We show that the chaos synchronization of a time-varying complex network is determined by means of the inner coupled link matrix, the eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors of the coupled configuration matrix, rather than the conventional eigenvalues of the coupled configuration matrix for a uniform network. Especially, we do not assume that the coupled configuration matrix is symmetric and its off-diagonal elements are nonnegative, which in a way generalizes the related results existing in the literature. ?? 2003 Elsevier B.V.

To deal with the hybrid nature of the system, and the possible discontinuities of its solutions at switching times, a properly amended tracking control problem is defined and a feedback control law based on a discontinuous version of the classical internal model principle is proposed. The innovative design of the discrete-time dynamics of the compensator guarantees the robust existence of a steady-state response giving zero tracking error in the controlled output, and local convergence to it.},

abstract = {We study the stability of multi-agent system (MAS) formations with delayed exchange of information between the agents. The agents are described by second order systems. They communicate via a symmetric connected communication topology with constant, heterogeneous, symmetric delays between any two neighboring agents. We consider two different tasks for the MAS: rendezvous, where all agents meet at an arbitrary point, and flocking, where all agents reach a given formation and move in a predefined direction. Therefore, we propose a decentralized control algorithm with position coupling gains kji. We prove that the MAS achieves rendezvous for any constant delay if the communication topology is connected and the coupling gain is sufficiently small. For larger gains, rendezvous and flocking are delay-dependent, i.e., they are reached for any delay smaller than a bound which depends on kji. Thereby, the controllers can be tuned in a totally decentralized fashion, i.e., only based on the communication delays to their neighbors and not considering the delays in the rest of the network. For the analysis, we use both frequency and time domain methods to prove delay-independent and delay-dependent rendezvous and flocking, respectively.},

We find globally synchronized states in which the elements of the array evolve along a periodic orbit of the uncoupled map, while the spatial correlation along the array is such that an individual map sees all other maps in his present, current, state. For values of the nonlinear parameter such that the uncoupled maps are chaotic, time-delayed mutual coupling suppresses the chaotic behavior by stabilizing a periodic orbit that is unstable for the uncoupled maps. The stability analysis of the synchronized state allows us to calculate the range of the coupling strength in which global synchronization can be obtained.},

However, the inclusion of a communication infrastructure adds new challenges to control strategies and some problems may arise such as time delays, packet losses, sampling period, just to name a few. In this work, we consider that data is sampled with homogeneous sampling periods.

Additionally, results are extended to the case of non-uniform agents, and some simulations of synchronization in smart grids are introduced.},

abstract = {Many kinds of chaotic cryptosystems have been proposed. Chaotic systems dissipate information due to orbital instability with positive Lyapunov exponents and ergodicity. If these properties are appropriately utilized, chaotic cryptosystems are supposed to realize high security. However, most of the existing secure communication techniques using chaos do not have enough security. For example, secure communication protocols based on chaos synchronization require robustness which gives useful information to attackers. The cryptosystems based on direct applications of chaotic maps have been weak against linear and differential cryptoanalysis. In this paper, a new kind of chaotic cryptosystem which overcomes these difficulties to some extent is proposed. The cryptosystem is based on a discretization of the skew tent map. We also show some of the desirable properties of the proposed cryptosystem using dynamical characteristics. These properties regarding ciphertext randomness may be closely related to the cryptological security. Our new cryptosystem uses one step to connect the theory of commonly used cryptosystems and dynamical system theory},

One diagonal block is the linearization of the system as restricted to the hybrid invariant manifold, also called the hybrid zero dynamics. The other is the product of two sensitivity matrices related to the transverse dynamics-one pertaining to the impact map and the other pertaining to the closed-loop vector field. When either of these sensitivity matrices is sufficiently close to zero, the stability of the return map is determined solely by the stability of the hybrid zero dynamics. The second main result of the paper details the construction of a hybrid invariant manifold, such as that required by the first main theorem. Forward invariance follows from the methods of Byrnes and Isidori, and impact invariance is achieved by a novel construction of impact-updated control parameters. In addition to providing impact invariance, the construction allows entries of the impact sensitivity matrix of the transverse dynamics to be made arbitrarily small. A simulation example is provided where stable walking is achieved in a 5-link biped with series compliant actuation.},

abstract = {We point out the existence of a transition from partial to global generalized synchronization (GS) in symmetrically coupled structurally different time-delay systems of different orders using the auxiliary system approach and the mutual false nearest neighbor method. The present authors have recently reported that there exists a common GS manifold even in an ensemble of structurally nonidentical scalar time-delay systems with different fractal dimensions and shown that GS occurs simultaneously with phase synchronization (PS). In this paper we confirm that the above result is not confined just to scalar one-dimensional time-delay systems alone but there exists a similar type of transition even in the case of time-delay systems with different orders. We calculate the maximal transverse Lyapunov exponent to evaluate the asymptotic stability of the complete synchronization manifold of each of the main and the corresponding auxiliary systems, which in turn ensures the stability of the GS manifold between the main systems. Further we estimate the correlation coefficient and the correlation of probability of recurrence to establish the relation between GS and PS. We also calculate the mutual false nearest neighbor parameter which doubly confirms the occurrence of the global GS manifold.},

abstract = {We consider networks of coupled maps where the connections between units involve time delays. We show that, similar to the undelayed case, the synchronization of the network depends on the connection topology, characterized by the spectrum of the graph Laplacian. Consequently, scale-free and random networks are capable of synchronizing despite the delayed flow of information, whereas regular networks with nearest-neighbor connections and their small-world variants generally exhibit poor synchronization. On the other hand, connection delays can actually be conducive to synchronization, so that it is possible for the delayed system to synchronize where the undelayed system does not. Furthermore, the delays determine the synchronized dynamics, leading to the emergence of a wide range of new collective behavior which the individual units are incapable of producing in isolation.},

abstract = {The first version of this book has been improved and augmented in several directions (mainly by the first author supported by the second and third authors of the second version). The link between dissipativity and optimal control is now treated in more detail, and many proofs which were not provided in the first edition are now given in their entirety, making the book more self-contained. One difficulty one encounters when facing the literature on dissipative systems is that there are many different definitions of dissipativity and positive real transfer functions (one could say a proliferation), many different versions of the same fundamental mathematical object (like the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov Lemma), and it is not always an easy task to discover the links between them all. One objective of this book is to present those notions in a single volume and to try, if possible, to present their relationships in a clear way. Novel sections on descriptor (or singular) systems, discrete-time linear and nonlinear systems, some types of nonsmooth systems, viscosity solutions of the KYP Lemma set of equations, time-varying systems, unbounded differential inclusions, evolution variational inequalities, hyperstability, nonlinear H∞, input-to-state stability, have been added. Conditions under which the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov Lemma can be stated without assuming the minimality of the realization are provided in a specific section. Some general results (like well-posedness results for various types of evolution problems encountered in the book, definitions, matrix algebra tools, etc.) are presented in the Appendix, and many others are presented in the main text when they are needed for the first time. We thank J. Collado and S. Hadd who made us some remarks, and we remain of course open to any comments that may help us continue to improve our book.},

abstract = {Lower-limb prostheses provide a prime example of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) requiring the synergistic development of sensing, algorithms, and controllers. With a view towards better understanding CPSs of this form, this paper presents a systematic methodology using multidomain hybrid system models and optimization-based controllers to achieve human-like multicontact prosthetic walking on a custom-built prosthesis: AMPRO. To achieve this goal, unimpaired human locomotion data is collected and the nominal multicontact human gait is studied. Inspired by previous work which realized multicontact locomotion on the bipedal robot AMBER2, a hybrid system-based optimization problem utilizing the collected reference human gait as reference is utilized to formally design stable multicontact prosthetic gaits that can be implemented on the prosthesis directly. Leveraging control methods that stabilize bipedal walking robots-control Lyapunov function-based quadratic programs coupled with variable impedance control-an online optimization-based controller is formulated to realize the designed gait in both simulation and experimentally on AMPRO. Improved tracking and energy efficiency are seen when this methodology is implemented experimentally. Importantly, the resulting multicontact prosthetic walking captures the essentials of natural human walking both kinematically and kinetically. Note to Practitioners- Variable impedance control, as one of the most popular prosthetic controllers, has been used widely on powered prostheses with notable success. However, due to the passivity of this controller, heuristic feedback is required to adjust the control parameters for different subjects and motion modes. The end result is extensive testing time for users, coupled with non-optimal performance of prostheses. Motivated by the shortcomings in the current state-of-the-art, this work proposes a novel systematic methodology-including gait generation and optimization-based control based o- a multidomain hybrid system-to achieve prosthetic walking for a given subject. This method also aims to improve control optimality and efficiency while potentially reducing clinical tuning. The overarching technology utilized in this paper is the use of nominal human trajectories coupled with formal models and controllers that circumvent the need for excessive hand-tuning. In particular, rather than using a prerecorded trajectory (as is common), this work takes a different approach by using a human-inspired optimization problem to design a human-like gait for the amputee automatically. The proposed optimization framework uses the trajectory of a healthy subject as the reference and is subject to specific constraints (to ensure smooth transitions, torque and angle limitations) such that the output gait is applicable for implementation on the prosthetic device directly. The results of the offline optimization are then utilized to synthesize an online real-time optimization-based feedback controller that allows for pointwise optimal tracking on the prosthesis, thereby improving overall efficiency. The experimental results in this work suggest that this approach is able to achieve stable human-like multicontact prosthetic walking and also guarantees a more balanced performance compared to other traditional controllers (such as PD).},

abstract = {Direct methods for trajectory optimization are widely used for planning locally optimal trajectories of robotic systems. Many critical tasks, such as locomotion and manipulation, often involve impacting the ground or objects in the environment. Most state-of-the-art techniques treat the discontinuous dynamics that result from impacts as discrete modes and restrict the search for a complete path to a specified sequence through these modes. Here we present a novel method for trajectory planning of rigid-body systems that contact their environment through inelastic impacts and Coulomb friction. This method eliminates the requirement for a priori mode ordering. Motivated by the formulation of multi-contact dynamics as a Linear Complementarity Problem for forward simulation, the proposed algorithm poses the optimization problem as a Mathematical Program with Complementarity Constraints. We leverage Sequential Quadratic Programming to naturally resolve contact constraint forces while simultaneously optimizing a trajectory that satisfies the complementarity constraints. The method scales well to high-dimensional systems with large numbers of possible modes. We demonstrate the approach on four increasingly complex systems: rotating a pinned object with a finger, simple grasping and manipulation, planar walking with the Spring Flamingo robot, and high-speed bipedal running on the FastRunner platform.},

By employing the Lyapunov functional method combined with the stochastic analysis as well as the feedback control technique, several sufficient conditions are established that guarantee the exponentially mean-square synchronization of two identical delayed networks with stochastic disturbances. These sufficient conditions, which are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), can be solved efficiently by the LMI toolbox in Matlab. A particular feature of the LMI-based synchronization criteria is that they are dependent not only on the connection matrices in the drive networks and the feedback gains in the response networks, but also on the lower and upper bounds of the time-varying delay, and are therefore less conservative than the delay-independent ones. Two numerical examples are exploited to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed synchronization approaches.},

In this paper, a generic distance function is designed that can be used for this purpose. The so-called “peaking phenomenon”, which occurs when using the Euclidean distance to compare two hybrid trajectories, is circumvented by taking the hybrid nature of the system explicitly into account. Based on the proposed distance function, we define the stability of a trajectory and present sufficient Lyapunov-type conditions for hybrid system with state-triggered jumps. A constructive Lyapunov function design is presented for hybrid systems with affine flow and jump maps and a jump set that is a hyperplane. The stability conditions can then be verified using linear matrix conditions. Finally, for this class of systems, we present a tracking controller that asymptotically stabilises a given hybrid reference trajectory and we illustrate our results with an example.},

abstract = {Complex dynamical networks are attracting more and more attention due to their ubiquity in the natural world. This Letter presents several new delay-dependent conditions for a general complex dynamical network model with coupling delays, which guarantee the synchronized states to be asymptotically stable. These conditions are expressed as linear matrix inequalities, readily solvable by available numerical software. Both continuous- and discrete-time networks are taken into consideration. It is shown theoretically that the condition for continuous-time delayed networks developed in this Letter encompasses an established result in the literature as a special case. In addition, similar delay-dependent results are derived for discrete-time delayed networks, for the first time in the literature. The most important feature of the results obtained in this Letter is that they are less conservative, which is illustrated by a numerical example. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Byrnes1991,
abstract = {In this paper, we derive conditions under which a nonlineasrystem can be rendered passive via smooth state feedback and we show that, as in the case linear systems, this is possible if and only if the system in question has relative degree 1 and is weakly minimum phase. Then, we prove that weakly minimum phase nonlinear systems having relative degree 1 can be globally asymptotically stabilized by smooth state feedback, provided that suitable controllability-like rank conditions are satisfied. This result incorporates and extends a number of stabilization schemes recently proposed in the literature for global asymptotic stabilization of certain classes of nonlinear systems.},
