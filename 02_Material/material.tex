\chapter{Mechanical Systems with Unilateral Constraints and Spatial Friction}\label{ch:model}
\textbf{ADD ASSUMPTIONS 1-6 FROM RIJNEN2017}
In this chapter several modeling approaches of mechanical systems with unilateral constraints and spatial friction are presented. First a general representation of such a system is given, which is followed by sections introducing several formulations of the contact and friction laws in these systems. First a complementarity problem formulation is given, which is a complete and often used formulation for mechanical systems with unilateral constraints. From the complementarity formulation a hybrid system formulation is derived, which although less complete is a more intuitive formulation from a control point-of-view.
\section{General system definition}
For mechanical systems a set of contact points $i_c\in\{i_1,i_2,...,i_C\}$ is defined, with $C$ being the number of considered contact points. A set $\Ic_{\text{cl}}$ is defined as the set of closed contact points, such that a contact $i_c\in\Ic_{\text{cl}}$ has closed a unilateral constraint. The set of contact points in open contact is defined as $\Ic_{\text{op}} := \{i_c\ |\ i_c\notin\Ic_{\text{cl}}\}$. When a unilateral constraint is activated at a nonzero velocity impact happens, meaning a jump in the velocity will appear. Therefore the generalized velocity $\dot{\qb}$ is not continuously defined over the entire domain of a trajectory with impacts. Therefore $\xib:=\dot{\qb}$ is defined, except at impact-times $\tau_i$. Here $i$ is a counter for unilateral constraint activations where $i\in \{1,2,...,N\}$, with $N$ the amount of jumps in a trajectory. $h_n$ is the normal contact distance and $\zeta_{n,i_c}$ and $\zetab_{t,i_c}$ represent the relative velocities in normal and tangential direction,  respectively. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:contactplanes} a body and a fixed world surface are illustrated. A contact point $i_c$ is defined on the body, on which a plane tangent to the surface of the body is spanned. On the normal direction of this plane, the contact distance $h_{n,i_c}(\qb)$ is defined. This is the distance between the contact point and the surface that it can make contact with. By taking the time derivative of $h_{n,i_c}(\qb)$, the relative normal velocity of contact point $i_c$ is found to be
\begin{align}
\zeta_{n,i_c} = \frac{\partial h_{n,i_c}}{\partial\qb}\frac{\text{d}\qb}{\text{d} t} = \wb_{n,i_c}^T\dot{\qb},
\end{align}
with $\wb_{n,i_c}^T$ representing the Jacobian of the normal velocity $\zeta_{n,i_c}$. The relative tangential velocity $\zetab_{t,i_c}$ is defined in the tangent plane of $i_c$, and thus lies perpendicular to $\zeta_{n,i_c}$. Using the tangential velocity jacobian $\Wb_{t,i_c}$, the relative tangential velocity is defined as
\begin{align}
\zetab_{t,i_c} = \Wb_{t,i_c}^T\dot{\qb}.
\end{align}

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{contactplanes.eps}\caption{An illustration of a body impacting the fixed world. A contact point $i_c$ is defined on the body, which can make contact with the fixed world at $i_{FW}$. The points $i_c$ and $i_{FW}$ are connected by a line which is perpendicular to their respective bodies, which is used to define the contact distance $h_{n,i_c}$ and normal contact velocity $\zeta_{n,i_c}$. In the plane tangent to the body's surface, the tangential contact velocity $\zetab_{t,i_c}$ is defined.} \label{fig:contactplanes}
\end{figure}

Then, the continuous dynamics of a mechanical system with unilateral constraints and spatial friction are of the form
\begin{align}
&\Mb(\qb)\dot{\xib} + \Hb(\qb,\xib) = \Sb(\qb)\ub + \sum_{i_c\in\Ic_{\text{cl}}}\left(\wb_{n,i_c}(\qb)\lambda_{n,i_c} + \Wb_{t,i_c}(\qb)\lambdab_{t,i_c} \right), \label{eq:appcont1}\\
&\text{(Contact Law)},\label{eq:appcont2}\\
&\text{(Friction Law)},\label{eq:appcont3}
\end{align}
with $\qb,\xib\in\Rbb^{n}$ and $\ub\in\Rbb^m$. Here $\Mb(\qb)\in\Rbb^{n\times n}$ is the mass matrix of the system, $\Hb(\qb,\xib)\in\Rbb^{n}$ contains the centripetal, Coriolis and gravitational forces in the system and $\Sb(\qb)\in\Rbb^{n\times m}$ represents the generalized directions of the forces. $\lambda_{n,i_c}\in\Rbb$ and $\lambdab_{t,i_c}\in\Rbb^{2}$ are the normal and tangential reaction forces, respectively, of contact point $i_c$ with $\wb_{n,i_c}\in\Rbb^{n}$ and $\Wb_{t,i_c}\in\Rbb^{n\times 2}$ the corresponding reaction force jacobians. When a contact point activates a unilateral constraint, impulsive dynamics can cause the state of the system to jump. These dynamics are of the form

\begin{align}
&\Mb(\qb)(\xib^+ - \xib^-) = \sum_{i_c\in\Ic_{\text{cl}}}\left( \wb_{n,i_c}(\qb)\Lambda_{n,i_c} + \Wb_{t,i_c}(\qb)\Lambdab_{t,i_c}\right), \label{eq:appimp1}\\
&\text{(Impulsive Contact Law)},\label{eq:appimp2}\\
&\text{(Impulsive Friction Law)}.\label{eq:appimp3}
\end{align}
Here $\Lambda_{n,i_c}$ and $\Lambdab_{t,i_c}$ the normal and tangential impulsive reaction forces, respectively, of contact point $i_c$. These dynamics are impulsive, and happen at one instance in time. The $^-$ superscript indicates the ante-event state and the $^+$ superscript indicates the post-event state. In the following sections three different methods of describing the contact and friction laws are presented. First a complementarity problem formulation of mechanical systems with unilateral constraints is given, from which later a proximal point formulation and a hybrid system formulation are derived. For more information on modeling of multibody systems one can refer to \cite{Leine2008} and \cite{Wouw2016}.

\section{Complementarity problem formulation}\label{sec:comp}
\subsection{Signorini's contact law and Poisson's impact law}
To describe the normal contact between rigid bodies Signorini's contact law is used. Since the bodies are impenetrable and reaction forces caused by contact can not prevent the bodies from seperating, both the contact distance $h_{n,i_c}$ and $\lambda_{n,i_c}$ can not become negative. Two situations are possible

\begin{enumerate}
\item $h_{n,i_c}=0\ \wedge\ \lambda_{n,i_c} \geq 0$ (closed-contact)
\item $h_{n,i_c}>0\ \wedge\ \lambda_{n,i_c} = 0$ (open-contact)
\end{enumerate}

These situations are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:signorinicontact}, where it can be seen that the two situations are orthogonal. This behavior can be summarized in the complementarity condition

\begin{align}
0\leq h_{n,i_c}\ \bot\ \lambda_{n,i_c} \geq 0,\label{eq:signorini}
\end{align}

where the symbol $\bot$ is used to express the orthogonality between $h_{n,i_c}$ and $\lambda_{n,i_c}$. The complementarity condition in \eqref{eq:signorini} is called Signorini's contact law.
\begin{figure}[h]

\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{poissonimpact.eps}
\caption{Poisson's impact law without restitution.}\label{fig:poissonimpact}
\end{subfigure}
\caption{}
\end{figure}

When contact happens at nonzero velocity, impact occurs. Newton's impact law is used to describe this impact. Newton's law of impact is defined as
\begin{align}
\zeta^+_{n,i_c} = -e_{n,i_c}\zeta^-_{n,i_c},\text{ when }h_{n,i_c}=0,\ \dot{h}_{n,i_c}<0.
\end{align}
In this work the coefficient of restitution $e_{n,i_c}$ is assumed to be $0$, describing a completely inelastic contact. For closed contact an impact law can be defined that relates the impulsive contact force $\Lambda_{n,i_c}$ to the post-impact normal velocity $\zeta_{n,i_c}$. When considering multi-contact systems, when a contact is closed two situations can occur:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $\Lambda_{n,i_c} > 0\ \wedge\ \zeta^+_{n,i_c} = 0$ (impact)
\item $\Lambda_{n,i_c} = 0\ \wedge\ \zeta^+_{n,i_c} \geq 0$ (no impact)
\end{enumerate}
The second case can occur when a contact point other than $i_c$ makes impact. The situations described above are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:poissonimpact}, where again the orthogonality can be observed. The behavior is written into the complementarity condition

\begin{align}
0\leq \zeta^+_{n,i_c}\ \bot\ \Lambda_{n,i_c} \geq 0,\quad  \qquad \forall i_c\in\Ic_{\text{cl}},\label{eq:poisson}
\end{align}

with $\Ic_{\text{cl}}$ the set of closed contacts. The complementarity condition \eqref{eq:poisson} is called Poisson's impact law. Note that the impact law is defined on velocity level, whereas the contact law is defined on position level.
\subsection{Coulomb's friction law}
Coulomb's friction law is often used to describe dry friction in mechanical systems. When considering 3-dimensional environments, Coulomb's friction law is defined as 

\begin{align}
||\lambdab_{t,i_c}||\ \in\ \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
||\lambdab_{t,i_c}||\leq\mu\lambda_{n,i_c}, &\text{if }||\zetab_{t,i_c}||=0\\
||\lambdab_{t,i_c}|| = \mu\lambda_{n,i_c}, &\text{if }||\zetab_{t,i_c}||>0
\end{array}\right.,\label{eq:frictionlen}
\end{align}
and since friction is considered isotropic
\begin{align}
\zetab_{t,i_c} = -\kappa_{i_c}\SgnSp(\lambdab_{t,i_c}),\label{eq:frictiondir}
\end{align}
with $\kappa_{i_c}>0$ and
\begin{equation}
\SgnSp(a) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
\frac{a}{||a||} & a \neq 0\\
0 & a = 0
\end{array},\right.
\end{equation}

for a vector $a$ as defined in \cite{Studer2006}.

\eqref{eq:frictionlen} can be considered as a relation between the magnitude of the tangential velocity $\zetab_{t,i_c}$ and the reaction friction force $\lambdab_{t,i_c}$. \eqref{eq:frictiondir} can be considered as a relation between the direction of $\zetab_{t,i_c}$ and $\lambdab_{t,i_c}$, namely that $\zetab_{t,i_c}$ and $\lambdab_{t,i_c}$ are always in opposite directions. The constant $\kappa_{i_c}$ can then be interpreted as the magnitude of the tangential velocity. Coulomb's friction law is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:coulombfriction}. In Figure~\ref{fig:coulombort} the same law is illustrated, but now as orthogonal vectors. As noticed earlier, this is convenient for writing the law in a complementarity form.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\begin{subfigure}{0.38\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{coulombfriction.eps}\caption{Coulomb's friction law.}\vspace{1.25cm}\label{fig:coulombfriction}
\end{subfigure}
\qquad
\begin{subfigure}{0.3\textwidth}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{coulombort.eps}\caption{Coulomb's friction law as orthogonal vectors. $\kappa_{i_c}$ is defined as the magnitude of the tangential velocity $\zetab_{t,i_c}$.}\label{fig:coulombort}
\end{subfigure}
\end{figure}

The complementarity formulation of the Coulomb's law is therefore defined as

\begin{align}
&0\leq \left(\mu\lambda_{n,i_c} - ||\lambdab_{t,i_c}||\right)\ \bot\ \kappa_{i_c} \geq 0,\label{eq:coulomb1}\\
&\zetab_{t,i_c} = -\kappa_{i_c}\SgnSp(\lambdab_{t,i_c}).\label{eq:coulomb2}
\end{align}

\eqref{eq:frictiondir} is rewritten to \eqref{eq:coulomb2} to avoid singularity problems for $||\lambdab_{t,i_c}|| = 0$. For the impulsive behavior of the friction law Newton's impact law is used to define the tangential post-impact velocity as
\begin{align}
\zetab^+_{t,i_c} = -e_{t,i_c}\zetab^-_{t,i_c},
\end{align}
where in this work $e_{t,i_c}=0$ is assumed. Then, similarly to the non-impulsive case, the impulsive Coulomb's friction law can be defined as
\begin{align}
&0 \leq (\mu\Lambda_{n,i_c} - ||\Lambdab_{t,i_c}||)\ \bot\ \kappa_{i_c} \geq 0. \qquad \forall i_c\in\Ic_{\text{cl}},\label{eq:coulombimp1}\\
&\zetab_{t,i_c}^+ = \kappa_{i_c}\SgnSp(\Lambdab_{t,i_c}),\qquad \forall i_c\in\Ic_{\text{cl}}.\label{eq:coulombimp2}
\end{align}
Note that just as the contact case, the impulsive friction law only holds for closed contacts.
\subsection{System dynamics with contact and friction law}
The flow dynamics are then described by
\begin{align}
&\Mb(\qb)\dot{\xib} + \Hb(\qb,\xib) = \Sb(\qb)\ub + \sum_{i_c\in\Ic_{\text{cl}}}\left(\wb_{n,i_c}(\qb)\lambda_{n,i_c} + \Wb_{t,i_c}(\qb)\lambdab_{t,i_c} \right), \label{eq:ncpcontact1}\\
&0\leq h_{n,i_c}\ \bot\ \lambda_{n,i_c} \geq 0,\label{eq:ncpcontact2}\\
&0\leq \left(\mu\lambda_{n,i_c} - ||\lambdab_{t,i_c}||\right)\ \bot\ \kappa_{i_c} \geq 0,\label{eq:ncpcontact3}\\
&\zetab_{t,i_c} = -\kappa_{i_c}\SgnSp(\lambdab_{t,i_c}),\label{eq:ncpcontact4}
\end{align}
with 
\begin{align}
&h_{n,i_c} = \wb_{n,i_c}^T(\qb)\qb,\label{eq:h}\\
&\zeta_{n,i_c}(\qb) = \wb^T_{n,i_c}(\qb) \xib,  \label{eq:zetan}\\
&\zetab_{t,i_c}(\qb) = \Wb^T_{t,i_c}(\qb) \xib. \label{eq:zetab}
\end{align}
The discrete dynamics, which take place when a contact point goes through an event, are described by
\begin{align}
&\Mb(\qb)(\xib^+ - \xib^-) = \sum_{i_c\in\Ic_{\text{cl}}}\left( \wb_{n,i_c}(\qb)\Lambda_{n,i_c} + \Wb_{t,i_c}(\qb)\Lambdab_{t,i_c}\right), \label{eq:ncpimpact1}\\
&0\leq \zeta_{n,i_c}^+\ \bot\ \Lambda_{n,i_c} \geq 0, \qquad \forall i_c\in\Ic_{\text{cl}},\label{eq:ncpimpact2}\\
&0 \leq (\mu\Lambda_{n,i_c} - ||\Lambdab_{t,i_c}||)\ \bot\ \kappa_{i_c} \geq 0. \qquad \forall i_c\in\Ic_{\text{cl}},\label{eq:ncpimpact3}\\
&\zetab_{t,i_c}^+ = -\kappa_i\SgnSp(\Lambdab_{t,i_c}),\qquad \forall i_c\in\Ic_{\text{cl}},\label{eq:ncpimpact4}
\end{align}
with 
\begin{align}
&\zeta^+_{n,i_c}(\qb) = \wb^T_{n,i_c}(\qb) \xib^+,\\
&\zetab^+_{t,i_c}(\qb) = \Wb^T_{t,i_c}(\qb) \xib^+.\label{eq:ncpimpactend}
\end{align}

\section{Hybrid system formulation}
In this section the dynamics of the complementarity system defined in Section~\ref{sec:comp} is written to a hybrid formulation, resulting in a hybrid framework for mechanical systems with unilateral constraints and spatial friction. The hybrid system formulation only holds for trajectories where only the contact points activating a guard function are allowed to change mode, i.e. no superfluous contacts. More information on the considered trajectories in this work is given in Section~\ref{app:trajectories}.

\subsection{Hybrid systems with impulsive effects}\label{sec:2hyb}
According to \cite{Haddad2006} an impulsive dynamical system can be described by a hybrid system with impulsive effects. This makes it a valid framework for mechanical systems with unilateral constraints and spatial friction. The notation given in \cite{Haddad2006} is convenient from a tracking point-of-view, in that only the dynamics encountered during the trajectory need to be described. A hybrid system with impulsive effects consists of three elements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Continuous dynamics, a continuous-time differential equation which defines the behavior of the system in between events
\item Discrete dynamics, which defines the way the state of the system is reset during events
\item Reset sets, which is a criterion to decide when the state of the system is to be reset
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, a hybrid system with impulsive effects is given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ll}
\dot{\xb}(t,i) =\fb_i(\xb(t,i),\ub(t,i),t),& \xb(t,i),\ub(t,i)\notin D_i\\
\xb(t,i) = \gb_i(\xb(t,i-1),\ub(t,i-1),t),& \xb(t,i-1),\ub(t,i-1)\in D_i
\end{array}\label{eq:hybimp}
\end{equation}
with $\xb(t,i)\in\Rbb^{n(i)}$, $\ub(t,i)\in\Rbb^{m(i)}$, $\fb_i(t,i)\ :\ \Rbb^{n(i)}\ \times\ \Rbb^{m(i)}\ \times\ \Rbb\rightarrow \Rbb^{n(i)}$. Note that the state dimension $n(i)$ and the input dimension $m(i)$ can vary in different modes $i$. For the difference equation we have $\gb_i\ :\ \Rbb^{n(i-1)}\ \times\ \Rbb^{m(i-1)}\ \times\ \Rbb\rightarrow \Rbb^{n(i)}$. The set $D_i = D_i(t) := \{\xb(t,i)\in\Rbb^{n(i)},\ \ub(t,i)\in\Rbb^{m(i)}\ |\ \gamma^{=}_i(\xb^{\wedge},\ub^{\wedge},t) = 0, \ \gamma^{\geq}_i(\xb^{\wedge},\ub^{\wedge},t) \geq 0\}$, where $\gamma^{=}_i$ and $\gamma^{\geq}_i$ are some sets of guard functions that are activated at event $i$, and $\xb^{\wedge}$,$\ub^{\wedge}$ are some virtual state and input that are not necessarily physically realistic.

The dynamics given in \eqref{eq:hybimp} will be used to describe a tracking problem for mechanical systems with unilateral constraints and spatial friction. A nominal state-input trajectory is considered consisting of absolutely continuous segments $(\alphab(t,i),\mub(t,i))$, with $t\in\left[\tau_i,\tau_{i+1}\right]$ and $i\in\{0,1,...,N\}$ the event counter. $\alphab(t,i)$ and $\mub(t,i)$ are the nominal state and input, respectively, that define the nominal trajectory with $N$ events. $\tau_i$ is referred to as the nominal event time of event $i$ and $t$ is referred to as regular time. Every segment of the nominal trajectory $(\alphab(t,i),\mub(t,i))$ and every event $i\in\{0,1,...,N\}$ satisfy the dynamics in \eqref{eq:hybimp}, where an event happens when $(\alphab(t,i),\mub(t,i))$ enters $D_{i+1}$. Such a nominal trajectory existing of absolutely continuous segments experiencing events according to \eqref{eq:hybimp} is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:2exampletraj}.

In \ref{fig:2example} an example trajectory of a block pushing towards a surface is illustrated. The block has two contact points on its edges $i_1$ and $i_2$. It starts with both contact points in open contact as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:2example1}. The flow is described by $\dot{\alphab}(t,0) = \fb_0(\alphab(t,0),\mub(t,0),t)$ for $t\in[t_0,\tau_1]$. Then $i_2$ makes impact with the surface at $\tau_1$, causing a jump in the state and a change in continuous dynamics $\dot{\alphab}(t,1) = \fb_1(\alphab(t,1),\mub(t,1),t)$ for $t\in[\tau_1,\tau_2]$. This is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:2example2}, where $i_2$ is in closed contact and slipping over the contact surface. At $\tau_2$, $i_1$ makes impact as well causing another jump and another change in continuous dynamics. The block now has both contact points slipping over the contact surface. After this both contact points release contact one by one. Since there are no impulsive forces present in this transition, the state does not jump when a contact point releases. However, a jump in the time-derivate of the state is possible, which makes these transitions continuous but nonsmooth.

\end{figure}

The following sections will be used to write the complementarity system defined in Section~\ref{sec:comp} into a hybrid system with impulsive effects as in \eqref{eq:hybimp}. In \ref{sec:2contdyn} the continuous dynamics $\fb_i$ will be derived for mechanical systems with unilateral constraints and spatial friction. Then, in Section~\ref{sec:2event} the reset set $D_i$ will be defined. Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:2discdyn} the discrete dynamics $\gb_i$ will be derived. This will fully define the hybrid system with impulsive effects formulation of mechanical systems with unilateral constraints and spatial friction.

\subsection{Continuous dynamics}\label{sec:2contdyn}
When describing mechanical systems, we take 

\begin{align}
\xb = \begin{bmatrix}
\qb\\ \dot{\qb}
\end{bmatrix},\quad
\dot{\xb} = \begin{bmatrix}
\dot{\qb}\\ \ddot{\qb}
\end{bmatrix},
\end{align}

where $\qb$ and $\dot{\qb}$ are the joint positions, velocities and accelerations respectively. As described in Section~\ref{sec:comp}, for mechanical systems a set of contact points $i_c\in\{i_1,i_2,...,i_C\}$ is defined. Here $C$ is the number of considered contact points. A set $\Ic_{\text{cl}}$ is defined as the set of closed contact points, such that a contact $i\in\Ic_{\text{cl}}$ has closed a unilateral constraint. The set of contact points in open contact is defined as $\Ic_{\text{op}} := \{i_c\ |\ i_c\notin\Ic_{\text{cl}}\}$. The set $\Ic_{\text{cl}}$ is subdivided in two subsets $\Ic_{\text{sl}}$ and $\Ic_{\text{st}}$, where $\Ic_{\text{sl}}$ is the set of closed contact points in slip and $\Ic_{\text{st}}$ the set of closed contact points in stick. Here $\Ic_{\text{cl}} =\Ic_{\text{sl}}\cup\Ic_{\text{st}}$ and $\Ic_{\text{sl}}\cup\Ic_{\text{st}}=\emptyset$. 

The equations of motion, given in \eqref{eq:appcont1}, can be rewritten to
\begin{align}
\ddot{\qb} = \Mb^{-1}(\qb)\left[ \Sb(\qb)\ub - \Hb(\qb,\dot{\qb}) + \Wb_{n}(\qb)\lambdab_{n} + \Wb_{t}(\qb)\lambdab_{t}\right],\label{eq:qddot}
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
\Wb_n &= \begin{bmatrix}
\wb_{n,i_1},\wb_{n,i_2},...,\wb_{n,i_c}
\end{bmatrix}\in\Rbb^{n\times C},\\
\Wb_t &= \begin{bmatrix}
\Wb_{t,i_1},\Wb_{t,i_2},...,\Wb_{t,i_c} 
\end{bmatrix}\in\Rbb^{n\times 2C},\\
\lambdab_n &= \begin{bmatrix}
\lambda_{n,i_1};\lambda_{n,i_2};...;\lambda_{n,i_C} 
\end{bmatrix}\in\Rbb^{C},\\
\lambdab_t &= \begin{bmatrix}
\lambdab_{t,i_1};\lambdab_{t,i_2};...;\lambdab_{t,i_C} 
\end{bmatrix}\in\Rbb^{2C},
\end{align}
Note that since $\fb_i$ is only defined on $\xb(t,i),\ub(t,i)\notin D_i$, it is not necessary to use $\xib$ to define the equations of motion as done in \eqref{eq:appcont1}. Now $\fb_i$ can be written as
\begin{align}
\dot{\xb}(t,i) =\begin{bmatrix}
\dot{\qb}\\ \Mb^{-1}(\qb)\left[ \Sb(\qb)\ub - \Hb(\qb,\dot{\qb}) + \Wb_{n}(\qb)\lambdab_{n} + \Wb_{t}(\qb)\lambdab_{t}\right]
\end{bmatrix}.\label{eq:fcont}
\end{align}
The closed contact points in $\Ic_{\text{cl}}$ experience reaction forces $\lambda_{n,i_c}$ and $\lambdab_{t,i_c}$, as can be seen in \eqref{eq:qddot}. Therefore for all closed contact points $i_c\in\Ic_{\text{cl}}$ constraints are given which define these reaction forces. These constraints are given by
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{ll}
\wb^T_{n,i_c}(\qb)\ddot{\qb} + \dot{\wb}^T_{n,i_c}(\qb)\dot{\qb} = 0, & \forall i_c\in\Ic_{\text{cl}},\\
\lambdab_{t,i_c} + \mu\lambda_{n,i_c}\SgnSp(\Wb_{t,i_c}^T\dot{\qb}) = 0, & \forall i_c\in\Ic_{\text{sl}},\\
\Wb^T_{t,i_c}(\qb)\ddot{\qb} + \dot{\Wb}^T_{t,i_c}(\qb)\dot{\qb} = 0, & \forall i_c\in\Ic_{\text{st}},
\end{array}\label{eq:fcontconst}
\end{equation}
where $\Ic_{\text{sl}}$ and $\Ic_{\text{st}}$ are the sets of closed contacts in slip and closed contacts in stick respectively. Now, with \eqref{eq:fcont} and \eqref{eq:fcontconst}, the continuous dynamics of the hybrid system with impulsive dynamics are correctly defined. A more thorough derivation of these dynamics can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:hybrid}.

\subsection{Discrete event sets}\label{sec:2event}
When the continuous dynamics enter an event set $D$, an event will take place. Such an event can cause a contact point to enter a different set, which will lead to different post-event continuous dynamics, and it can cause the state to reinitialize according to the discrete dynamics presented in Section~\ref{sec:2discdyn}. For each set of contact points these sets are defined differently. In this section the sets $D$ are defined for each set of contact points. The derivation of the discrete event sets can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:hybrid}.

\textbf{DONT SEPARATE, CREATE ONE DEFINITION WHERE YOU ITERATE OVER ALL POSSIBILITIES UNTIL ONE COMBINATION OF CONTACT POINT MODES IS FEASIBLE}\\
\textbf{Discrete events sets in open contact} $D_{\text{op}\rightarrow}$\\
For all contact points $i_c\in\Ic_{\text{op}}$ the discrete event sets are defined as
\begin{align}
D_{\text{op}\rightarrow\text{sl}} &= \{ \qb\ |\ \gamma_{\text{op}\rightarrow\text{cl}} = 0,\ \dot{\gamma}_{\text{op}\rightarrow\text{cl}} < 0,\ \Gamma < 0 \},\\
D_{\text{op}\rightarrow\text{st}} &= \{ \qb\ |\ \gamma_{\text{op}\rightarrow\text{cl}} = 0,\ \dot{\gamma}_{\text{op}\rightarrow\text{cl}} < 0,\ \Gamma \geq 0 \},
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
\gamma_{\text{op}\rightarrow\text{cl}} &= h_{n,i_c}(\qb),\\
\Gamma &= \mu^2\underline{\Lambda}^2_{n,i_c}(\qb,\dot{\qb})-\underline{\Lambdab}_{t,i_c}(\qb,\dot{\qb})\underline{\Lambdab}^T_{t,i_c}(\qb,\dot{\qb}).
\end{align}

\textbf{Discrete events sets in closed contact slip} $D_{\text{sl}\rightarrow}$\\
For all contact points $i_c\in\Ic_{\text{sl}}$ the discrete event sets are defined as
\begin{align}
D_{\text{sl}\rightarrow\text{st}} &= \{ \qb\ |\ \gamma_{\text{sl}\rightarrow\text{st}} = 0,\ \dot{\gamma}_{\text{sl}\rightarrow\text{st}} < 0\}\\
D_{\text{sl}\rightarrow\text{op}} &= \{ \qb,\ub\ |\ \gamma_{\text{cl}\rightarrow\text{op}} = 0,\ \dot{\gamma}_{\text{cl}\rightarrow\text{op}} < 0\},
\end{align}
with 
\begin{align}
\gamma_{\text{sl}\rightarrow\text{st}} &= \zetab_{t,i_c}\zetab_{t,i_c}^T\\
\gamma_{\text{cl}\rightarrow\text{op}} &= \lambda_{n,i_c}.
\end{align}

\textbf{Discrete events sets in closed contact stick} $D_{\text{st}\rightarrow}$\\
For all contact points $i_c\in\Ic_{\text{st}}$ the discrete event sets are defined as
\begin{align}
D_{\text{st}\rightarrow\text{sl}} &= \{ \qb,\ub\ |\ \gamma_{\text{st}\rightarrow\text{sl}} = 0,\ \dot{\gamma}_{\text{sl}\rightarrow\text{st}} < 0\}\\
D_{\text{st}\rightarrow\text{op}} &= \{ \qb,\ub\ |\ \gamma_{\text{cl}\rightarrow\text{op}} = 0,\ \dot{\gamma}_{\text{cl}\rightarrow\text{op}} < 0\},
\end{align}
with 
\begin{align}
\gamma_{\text{st}\rightarrow\text{sl}} &= \mu^2\lambda_{n,i_c}^2-\lambdab_{t,i_c}\lambdab_{t,i_c}^T\\
\gamma_{\text{cl}\rightarrow\text{op}} &= \lambda_{n,i_c}.
\end{align}

\subsection{Discrete dynamics}\label{sec:2discdyn}
When a discrete event set $D$ is entered, the discrete dynamics describe the reinitialization of the state. The discrete dynamics are defined by a jump map $\gb$. Since there are three different modes for each contact point, three different discrete dynamics functions should be defined: one for a reinitialization into slip, one for a reinitialization into stick and one for a reinitialization into open-contact.

\textbf{DONT SEPARATE, CREATE ONE DEFINITION OF DISCRETE DYNAMICS WITH THE CONTACT POINTS IN DIFFERENT MODES}\\
\textbf{Slip post-event mode} $\dot{\qb}^+ = \gb_{\rightarrow\text{sl}}(\dot{\qb}^-)$\\
From the impulsive dynamics \eqref{eq:ncpimpact1}-\eqref{eq:ncpimpact4}, the discrete dynamics of a transition with a slip post-impact mode can be derived as
\begin{align}
&\dot{\qb}^+ = \Mb^{-1}\left[\Wb_{n}\Lambdab_{n} + \Wb_{t}\Lambdab_{t}\right] + \dot{\qb}^-,\label{eq:discslip1}\\
&\wb^T_{n,i_c}\dot{\qb}^+ = 0,\label{eq:discslip2}\\
&\Lambdab_{t,i_c} = -\mu\Lambda_{n,i_c}\SgnSp(\zetab^-_{t,i_c}).\label{eq:discslip3}
\end{align}


Note that when there is a transition from stick to slip, i.e., there is no impact, the post-event velocity is $\dot{\qb}^+ = \dot{\qb}^-$. The acceleration is allowed to jump, which means that in this case the state is continuous, but not differentiable. This is called a Filippov-discontinuity \cite{Filippov1988}.

\textbf{Stick post-event mode} $\dot{\qb}^+ = \gb_{\rightarrow\text{st}}(\dot{\qb}^-)$\\
The discrete dynamics of a transition with a stick post-impact mode are given by
\begin{align}
&\dot{\qb}^+ = \Mb^{-1}\Wb_{n}\Lambdab_{n} + \Mb^{-1}\Wb_{t}\Lambdab_{t} + \dot{\qb}^-,\label{eq:discstick1}\\
&\wb^T_{n,i_c}\dot{\qb}^+ = 0,\label{eq:discstick2}\\
&\Wb^T_{t,i_c}\dot{\qb}^+ = 0.\label{eq:discstick3}
\end{align}
Similarly to the stick to slip case, note that when the transition from slip to stick is also a Filippov-discontinuity.

\textbf{Open-contact post-event mode} $\dot{\qb}^+ = \gb_{\rightarrow\text{op}}(\dot{\qb}^-)$\\
In the open-contact post-event mode case there are no impulsive reaction forces, and it is trivial to see from \eqref{eq:ncpimpact1} that the jump map $\dot{\qb}^+ = \gb_{\rightarrow\text{op}}(\dot{\qb}^-)$ is given by
\begin{align}
\dot{\qb}^+ = \dot{\qb}^-.\label{eq:gopen}
\end{align}
