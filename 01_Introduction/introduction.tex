\chapter{Introduction}
\section{Context}
In many applications of mechanical systems physical interaction with the environment is necessary to function, particularly in robotics. Humanoid robots, industrial robots, surgical robots are some examples of robotics that require physical interaction with their environment to function. Straightforward control strategies that are available for these applications, are limiting in performance. To avoid complexity of the controller, they often assume contact with their environment to happen at zero speed. This makes the robots less suitable for situations where speed is of significance, e.g., for industrial or walking robots. Higher performance is desirable in such cases. However, making contact with your environment at non-zero velocities complicates the control problem.

When two bodies make physical contact at a considerable velocity, impact occurs. Impact is a complex physical event, that is characterized by very short durations, high force levels, high energy dissipation rates, and large accelerations and decelerations. Due to the small time scale at which impacts happen, the impact is often modeled by assuming that the change in velocity during impact happens due to an impulsive force, i.e., the velocity jump happens in zero time. Systems exhibiting such dynamics are often represented as \textit{non-smooth}. In dynamics, the state doesn't necessarily have to be a smooth function of time, meaning that not all it's time-derivatives exist. Non-smooth mechanical systems with impact are systems that have discontinuities in their state-evolution. Mechanical systems with unilateral constraints are an example of systems that can exhibit non-smooth behavior, as they can jump in state when the unilateral constraints are closed. Control strategies for such systems are necessary to achieve better performance. 

\section{Non-smooth modeling frameworks}
Non-smooth systems can be described by several mathematical frameworks, e.g., singularly perturbed systems, hybrid systems, complementarity systems and (measure-)differential inclusions \cite{Leine2004}. The singular perturbation framework approximates the non-smooth behaviour using a singularly perturbed smooth system. In this way, the singularly perturbed system can be evaluated numerically using a single smooth differential equation. However, due to the smooth approximation extremely small time-steps are necessary which makes the system less suitable for simulation. More suitable for this are differential inclusions, which are applicable to systems with a discontinuous right-hand side but a time-continuous state-evolution (also called Filippov-systems) \cite{Filippov1988}. A common example of Filippov-systems are systems including friction. The differential inclusion gives a description of the non-smooth dynamics in a single inclusion. However, mechanical systems with unilateral constraints and impact do not satisfy the requirement of having a time-continuous state-evolution. A measure-differential inclusion describes the continuous as well as the impulsive dynamics of a non-smooth system \cite{Leine2008b}. In this way, measure-differential inclusions are suitable for systems with time-discontinuities in their state-evolution \cite{Moreau1988,Brogliato1999}. Using this approach the dynamics can be accurately integrated using the timestepping method \cite{Wouwa}. From a control point-of-view the complementarity framework is often considered. This framework describes non-smoothness through a combination of differential equations and inequalities \cite{VanDerSchaft1998,Heemels1999}. In \cite{Glocker2001} the complementarity problem is used to describe mechanical systems with unilateral constraints. It plays a key role in mathematical programming, and several solutions for trajectory tracking using complementarity systems exist \cite{Bourgeot2005,Morarescu2010}. In recent years the hybrid systems framework has drawn more interest for solving the trajectory tracking problem of non-smooth systems \cite{Hyun2014,Morris2009}. A hybrid system is a dynamical system that exhibits both continuous and discrete dynamics behaviour, where it switches (discrete behaviour) between several differential equations (continuous behaviour) \cite{Goebel2009}. \textit{Guard functions} are defined, which when activated will cause the dynamics to switch from one differential equation to another and possibly reinitialize the state. This makes it a very intuitive approach to the modeling of non-smoothness. A known difficulty with this description however, is a phenomenon called Zeno-behaviour. One speaks of Zeno-behaviour when an infinite amount of guard activations happen in a finite time. A classic example is the bouncing ball. The framework of measure-differential inclusions would be more suitable in such a situation, because the impulsive dynamics are implicit in the inclusion. An advantage of using the hybrid systems framework, is that it is a more intuitive description of the dynamics whereas measure-differential inclusions are more abstract. The stability analyses for these frameworks are well-developed, i.e., \cite{Ye1998,Lygeros2003,Goebel2009} for hybrid systems, \cite{Pereira2004,Brogliato2004,Leine2008} for measure differential inclusions, and \cite{Brogliato1999,Camlibel2006,Camlibel2007} for linear complementarity problems.

\section{Trajectory tracking control for non-smooth systems}
Legged robotic systems account for a substantial part of the research done into the trajectory tracking control of mechanical systems with unilateral constraints. Many results in this area deal with the stability of periodic orbits of systems with impacts. In \cite{Raibert1984}, a first big step has been made into modeling and controlling a one-legged hopping robot. In this research, the energy-loss during impact is modelled through damping and coupling effects are modeled as perturbations. In \cite{Grizzle2001}, the hybrid framework is adopted to find stable walking gaits for biped robots. Using Poincar\'{e} maps in \cite{Parker1989}, the stability of periodic orbits with discontinuities of under-actuated systems are analyzed. \cite{Ames2014} continues on this work, generating control laws using data of walking humans and in \cite{Reher2016} the energy-efficiency of generated walking gaits has been the focus. The analysis of stable walking gaits is applied to the MIT Cheetah in \cite{Hyun2014}, where a stability analysis and controller design is presented for the trot-running of a quadrupedal robot. In \cite{Menini2001,Galeani2008}, quasi-stability is introduced for systems with periodic trajectories in the so-called \textit{Birkhoff billiard}. This notion of stability defines asymptotic stability for the periodic trajectory, except for the time-instants where impacts happen.
  
There has been made considerable progress in the field of walking robots and billiards, but it is easy to think of a an example where non-periodic trajectories are of interest. Under the assumption that the state trajectory jumps at the exact same time as the reference trajectory, the trajectory tracking problem for non-smooth systems had been solved multiple times. The tracking problem for Lur'e type systems has been analyzed in \cite{VanDeWouw2008,Wouw2010}, using MDI's to describe non-smooth and impulsive dynamics. This work uses the convergence property to provide a solution to the tracking problem, where the solution may be time-varying and exhibit state-jumps. In \cite{Bourgeot2005}, the passivity-based approach is used to solve the tracking control problem of complementarity Lagrangian systems. Asymptotic stability is achieved for Lagrangian systems with unilateral constraints. The same approach has been applied to the hybrid system framework in \cite{Naldi2013}, which results in a control law that can guarantee stability of a trajectory with multiple impacts. By embedding the reference trajectory with discontinuities into a set, Lyapunov tools can be used to analyze stability as in \cite{Sanfelice2011,Sanfelice2014}. In \cite{Posa2016} a stability analysis of systems with impacts and friction has been presented. The results are obtained using the measure-differential inclusion framework, resulting in a smooth control law.

In the prior discussed work, the tracking problem has often been solved under the assumption that the jump of the state occurs at the same time-instant as the jump of the desired trajectory, i.e., in \cite{Naldi2013,Sanfelice2014,Posa2016}. In reality, especially in high velocity conditions, the state jump and trajectory jump do not always coincide. In this case a phenomenon called \textit{peaking} occurs \cite{Biemond2013}. Spikes in the tracking error will arise around the jump times, which defy the notion of stability and are unfavorable when designing a stabilizing controller. Several solutions exist to solve this problem. Solutions exist for periodic orbits in \cite{Menini2001,Galeani2008}, where the results are compatible with a mismatch in reference jump-time and state jump-time. In \cite{Biemond2013,Biemond2016}, a novel definition of the tracking error is introduced, using a distance function which is not sensitive to jumps of the state and the reference trajectory. Lyapunov-based conditions for the global asymptotic stability of non-smooth trajectories have been derived. Another solution for the problem of a jump-time mismatch is proposed in \cite{Baumann2018}, in the form of a distance function similar to \cite{Biemond2013,Biemond2016} based on a quotient metric. When a state jump happens at different time than the reference jump, this approach applies the jump map to the reference to be able to compare the state to the reference. \cite{Kim2016} introduces a novel controller design using gluing functions to connect the start and end point of a jump in the state space. After gluing, the system can be considered a continuous or piecewise continuous function without state jumps. In \cite{Yang2017} a tracking error is defined by taking the smallest of two values: the ante-impact tracking error and post-impact tracking error.

\section{Reference spreading control}
In \cite{Saccon2014} a novel notion of error is defined by extending the reference trajectory segments over the entire domain of the state space, and considering the error between the trajectory and state that have encountered the same number of jumps. This notion of error, called \textit{reference spreading}, is the basis for extending the sensitivity analysis introduced in \cite{Khalil1996} to the hybrid system framework. These results are then used to obtain a local approximation of the perturbed state dynamics. This analysis gives insight in how the system behaves under the presence of perturbations, which is useful during controller design. In \cite{Rijnen2016,Rijnen2017}, the sensitivity analysis for hybrid systems with state triggered jumps is used for a trajectory tracking control strategy, which is named \textit{reference spreading control}. In \cite{Rijnen2017a} the reference spreading control law is used in simulations with an iCub robot. The iCub robot balances on one foot and keeps himself standing upright by making and breaking contact with a wall using on of his arms. Some snapshots of the motion are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:rijnen2017}. As mentioned earlier, many available results work under the assumption that the exact impact time is known. This is extremely limiting during implementation of the control law. Using the reference spreading approach, the impact time of the state is allowed to deviate from that of the reference, making implementation of the control law in practical applications more viable while still allowing for state-jumps.

\textbf{Talk about simulation Mark, and then from ordered to simultaneous} Impacts are often modeled using one point contact between two bodies. However, in practice more complex geometries can make contact with each other. A more realistic contact is used in \cite{Zhao2015}, in which a humanoid bipedal robot is modeled with multiple impacts when one of it's feet makes contact with the ground. One contact is modeled by a heel impact, a toe impact, a heel release, and finally a toe release; a series of impacts that happen in a certain order. 

When such geometries make contact, one can imagine that the order of impacts is not always known. Imagine for example the iCub in \cite{Rijnen2017a} having a physically realistic geometry at the end of it's arm. The arm can first make a point contact, then a line contact, and finally a surface contact in rapid succession.  However, at high velocities, these impacts will happen at an instant, and small perturbations can change the order of impact. When several impacts happen at the same time-instant, they can be called \textit{simultaneous impacts}. The approach used in \cite{Zhao2015} is not suitable for these challenging situations. 

The phenomenon of simultaneous impacts is first introduced in \cite{Chen2018a}, where the first step is taken into solving the trajectory tracking problem for such impacts. A hybrid system framework is used to model the impacts, where multiple guards can be activated at once. The reference spreading control in \cite{Rijnen2016,Rijnen2017} and the sensitivity analysis to approximate a system's behavior around trajectories with single guard activation, introduced in \cite{Saccon2014}, are extended to be suitable for simultaneous guard activation. The results of the sensitivity analyses are used to find suitable gains for the reference spreading control law. However, these results do not consider friction. In addition to an impulse perpendicular to the impact-surface, taking friction into account will result in a tangential impulse. Also the release phase is not considered in the work of \cite{Chen2018a}. During the release phase there is no discontinuity in the state-evolution, only a change in the number of active constraints on the system. Therefore, the aim of this research is to investigate both stability of impacts including friction and the release phase of contact.

\section{Contribution}

\subsection*{Simultaneous impacts with friction}
Friction elements are often disregarded when analyzing impacts. However, to set up a unifying theory friction elements should not be ignored. Tangential impulses can have a considerable effect on a system's dynamics. The impact laws used in the work of \cite{Chen2018a} can be extended using one of the several available friction laws \cite{Leine2008}. When impact laws are supplemented with a tangential element, this is often done using a Coulomb friction law \cite{Glocker2014a}. Besides the tangential impulse, also a Filippov-like discontinuity will be present due to Coulomb friction. Also in this work a Coulomb friction law is used, which can lead to more accurate models and controllers for mechanical systems with unilateral constraints.\\\\
\textbf{Research Objective:}\\
\textit{Find a model suitable to describe mechanical systems with unilateral constraints and spatial friction. The positive homogenization's notation and sensitivity analysis shall be adjusted to be compatible with such models.}

\subsection*{Simultaneous impacts with release}
In \cite{Rijnen2016} and \cite{Rijn2016}, the release phase of a system with a reference spreading controller has been extensively researched. However, these results only include single guard activation. The release phase for multiple guard activation is not yet investigated. In \cite{Chen2018a}, only a single contact is simulated for this reason. Extending the sensitivity analysis in \cite{Chen2018a} to be suitable for simultaneous releases would make it possible to simulate and control one trajectory with several simultaneous contacts and releases.\\\\
\textbf{Research Objective:}\\
\textit{Adjusting the positive homogenization, such that it is suitable for input-dependent guard functions. This will result in a positive homogenization suitable for trajectories that contain a releasing motion.}
